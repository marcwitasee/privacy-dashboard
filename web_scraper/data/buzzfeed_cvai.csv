In January 2020, this technology was used in a theft investigation and lead to a possible suspect. A cleaning person allegedly took an engagement ring from the victim’s home. A photograph of the suspect was obtained from the cleaning company’s website and was submitted to Clearview. Clearview identified a potential suspect. Further investigation verified the suspect worked for the cleaning company. The suspect pawned a ring at a Chicago pawnshop. The ring was recovered and identified by our victim as her previously stolen ring. Detectives called the suspect who agreed to come to the police station to be interviewed. The suspect arrived and confessed to taking the ring and then selling it at a local pawnshop. Once the interview was concluded, the suspect was allowed to leave the police station due to child care obligations.

Tacoma Police Department,WA,501-1000,"“After making further inquiries it was determined that we had one officer in an investigative capacity who was provided a free trial of the software and performed 794 searches with it. The officer said there were no arrests made that he is aware of from the searches. Our department will not be purchasing the software due to cost. No one else is using the software we are aware of and the free trial is no longer being utilized. He utilized the free trial from Nov. 2019 to Nov 2020. My superior said the free trial was long because of COVID, they dont know why it was such a long free trial but we never paid for it and they are not using it now.” —Wendy Haddow, public information officer"

It’s our understanding he used the software to search for himself and personal friends – and incorporated his experience into his curriculum for a course he teaches on Open Source Analysis for Narcotics Investigations. Any mention of this software has now been stripped from the training materials. And we’re now conducting a top-down review of all training programs. It’s important to note that his subscription was allowed to expire after the 30 days – our organization has not paid for an ongoing subscription and no one is currently using it.” —Karina Shagren, communications director"

Beckley Police Department,WV,101-500,"“Our agency utilized Clearview AI for a limited time during free trial period. The program was used to search surveillance images from shopliftings, thefts and suspect images from other crimes. There were no arrests attributed to Clearview and it was only utilized by a very small number of detectives. We are not currently using the software or another other facial recognition software at this time. I personally thought the software was fantastic and worked great. The problem we had was the quality of the surveillance images we uploaded to conduct the search. When doing a controlled search with a known subject for demonstration purposes; the software was really good and I don’t recall any mismatched results. However, like I stated in the previous email; we only used it for a limited time on a free trial basis.” —Lt. David Allard"

Wyoming Highway Patrol,WY,6-10,"“We tested [it] for a short period of time earlier this year, in the middle to end of February for about three weeks, but then discontinued it due to privacy concerns. We used it on troopers to see how it was working. The only time we used it on a case we had already confirmed the identity of a suspect who had an active homicide warrant and after we confirmed it was him through the tools we already use we tested that software to see if it would pull up same information. I don’t have information as to whether the Clearview search actually worked. Around the same time our captain was looking into it more in depth and he was having concerns about what he was hearing about it due to privacy concerns.” —Sgt. Jeremy Beck"
