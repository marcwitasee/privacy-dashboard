              </div>
              <p>Facial regcognition softwares are technologies that use artificial intelligence to identify faces in images and videos. It can also be used to identify people and categorize them by personal characteristics, such as gender or race. As the map on the left shows, the use of facial recognition is on the rise in the United States, particularly among public agencies like police departments. In some cases, there are concerns that public agencies could used facial recognition <a class='color-link' href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/548932-pressure-mounts-on-dhs-to-stop-using-clearview-ai-facial-recognition">to identify, locate, and deport undocumented immigrants</a> from the country as well as <a class='color-link' href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373316/nypd-facial-recognition-black-lives-matter-activist-derrick-ingram">track protestors attending Black Lives Matter rallies</a>.

              <h3>What is Clearview AI?</h3>
            </div>
            <p><a class="color-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html">Clearview AI</a> is a private company that sells a facial recognition software, which enables users to upload an image of a person and get back results of other pictures in which the person appears on the Internet. Clearview AI's software is built on a massive database of images that the company collected from social media accounts and other online sources. As some of these images may be linked to personal identifying information, Clearview AI's software poses a grave threat to people's privacy. Furthermore, it is unclear how well the technology accurately identifies persons in images that are uploaded.</p>
