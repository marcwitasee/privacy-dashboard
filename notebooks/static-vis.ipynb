A photograph of the suspect was obtained from the cleaning company\\u2019s website and was submitted to Clearview. Clearview identified a potential suspect. Further investigation verified the suspect worked for the cleaning company. The suspect pawned a ring at a Chicago pawnshop. The ring was recovered and identified by our victim as her previously stolen ring. Detectives called the suspect who agreed to come to the police station to be interviewed. The suspect arrived and confessed to taking the ring and then selling it at a local pawnshop. Once the interview was concluded, the suspect was allowed to leave the police station due to child care obligations.
